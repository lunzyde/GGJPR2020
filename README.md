"RRR: Rival Relationship Repairs" is a CO-OP Game inspired by the game Asteroids, only one button for each player to use their character. The story shows two rivals in their spaceships traveling around space to compete against one another, but then an asteroid hits one of them and it is up to both players to help each other out.
